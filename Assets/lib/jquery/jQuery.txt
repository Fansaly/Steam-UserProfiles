jQuery Pre-Release Builds
The jQuery team is constantly working to improve the code. Each commit to the Github repo generates a work-in-progress version of 
the code that we update on the jQuery CDN. These versions are sometimes unstable and not suitable for production sites. We recommend 
they be used to determine whether a bug has already been fixed when reporting bugs against released versions, or to see if new bugs 
have been introduced. There are two versions, one for the 1.x branch (supports IE 6/7/8) and one for the 2.x branch (not for use with old IE).
